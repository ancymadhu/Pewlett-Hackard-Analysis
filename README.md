# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Exploring databases with SQL using PostreSQL

### Overview of the Analysis
In Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis, we learned about data modeling, engineering, and analysis. Applying our knowledge of DataFrames and tabular data, we created entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), import data into a database, troubleshot common errors, and created queries that use data to answer questions using SQL techniques.
